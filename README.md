# A/B testing a new webpage design

##### A/B testing: A step-by-step guide of how to design and analyse an A/B test experiment in Python.
##### Inspired from a real project I worked on for an e-commerce business, the only difference here is that we're using public data from kaggle.

# Business Case 
I was part of the product team at a medium-sized e-commerce business. The UX designer worked on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told us that the current conversion rate is about 13% on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an increase of 2%, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%.

# Objective
Before rolling out the change, the team would be more comfortable testing it on a small number of users to see how it performs. I suggested running an A/B experiment on a subset of our user base.


# Steps 

1. Designing our experiment
2. Collecting and preparing the data
3. Visualising the results
4. Testing the hypothesis
5. Drawing conclusions
